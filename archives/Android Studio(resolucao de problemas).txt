I got a solution to this problem.

Follow these simple steps:

    Click File > Settings (on a Mac, Android Studio > Preferences) to open the Settings dialog.

    In the left pane, expand Build, Execution, Deployment and then click Gradle.
    Under Global Gradle settings, UNCHECK the Offline work checkbox.
    Click Apply or OK for your changes to take effect.

It will fix the problem.

For the internet connection use the HTTP proxy for Android Studio

Following steps:

    From the menu bar, click File > Settings (on a Mac, click Android Studio > Preferences).
    In the left pane, click Appearance & Behavior > System Settings > HTTP Proxy. The HTTP Proxy page appears.
    Select Auto-detect proxy settings to use an automatic proxy configuration URL for the proxy settings or Manual proxy configuration to enter each of the settings yourself. For a detailed explanation of these settings, visit official website.
    Click Apply or OK for your changes to take effect.
